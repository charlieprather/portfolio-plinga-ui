      <h3>Problem:</h3>


      <p>The in-game "button bar" is old and is having a few problems. Each game on Plinga's platform has a different button bar design and this makes things complicated for our Devs, especially when we release a new game. The button bar is also not up to date with design trends regarding aesthetics and functionality.</p>

      <h1>Brainstorming</h1>

      <p>While coming up with different ideas, I talked to people from different departments regarding current pain points and possible solutions. Some things that were talked about before any designing started were things like, will it be static on the page or will it push everything down when a button is clicked, like a classic hamburger menu.</p>

      <h1>Drawings in photoshop</h1>

      <p>Here are just a series of various ideas. This is more of an exercise in order to get see what is inspiring to myself and especially my colleuges. The further down the hole I went, the more clean and basic I think the design needed to be, in order to really represent Plinga but also express a universality.</p>

      <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>We have decided to explore ideas that are primarily white, with lighter colors. Also, we have started discussing the idea of different options when it comes to interaction with the iframe itself. Should it push the whole things down, lay on top of it, or be permanently fixed on the top? These are important questions because various platforms that have our games, have UI elements that we don't want to disrupt.</p>

      <p>Here I have a selected group of working button bar prototypes.

<div class="column">
            <h2>1.</h2>
            <p>This design was first created in an attempt to hide the buttons and experiment with subtle animations. I also created it so we could experiment with idea of having a fixed button bar at the top</p>

            <h2>2.</h2>
            <p>We experimented with the idea of hiding the button bar and adding a sublte animations to tell the user where the button bar is located. This was created to push the entire iframe(where the games are located) down.</p>

            <h2>3.</h2>
            <p>This design was created to replicate notions of a tab/button bar. It has fast jQuery animations and relatively small buttons in contrast to the other buttons. I also made this design so we could experiment with the idea of having the button bar float ontop of the iFrame.</p>

    <h1>Challenges, takeaways, and things learned</h1>


    <p>The biggest challenge that I came across working on this project was making something that was universal for our clients but still subtly representing Plinga. A big challenege the team experienced was, once we had a design that we wanted to move forward with, we had to determin if we wanted to use SVGs for the icons, did we want to use Font Awesome, or pngs? </p> <p> Some key takeaways were deepening my understanding of how jQuery works with animations and also working on a design that is universally accessible to people regardless of age or language.</p> <p> I learned quite a bit from this project, mostly regarding how to work with the needs of a plethora of clients, and how to design something that is universal for so many platforms' supporting our games.</p>
